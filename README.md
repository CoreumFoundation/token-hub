# 🌐 Smart Tokens on the Coreum Network

The Coreum TokenHub empowers enterprises and users alike to create and manage Smart Tokens. With predefined behaviors and deterministic gas fees, tokens issued on Coreum are able to execute advanced, contract-like functions directly on the blockchain. The platform provides a robust framework for token management, offering flexibility and control to meet diverse business, user, and community needs.

## 🛠️ Create

### Fungible Tokens (FTs)

Your Fungible Tokens will inherit features that dictate their behavior:

- **Symbol:** TOKEN
- **Subunit:** utoken
- **Precision:** 0
- **Initial Amount:** 0
- **URL:** [http://example.com](http://example.com)
- **Description:** Enter Token Description
- **Burn Rate:** 0
- **Send Commission Rate:** 0

### 🎨 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

Your Non-Fungible Tokens will be part of a collection that defines their behavior. Post creation, you can mint NFTs and transfer them:

- **Name:** Collection Name
- **Symbol:** TOKEN
- **URI:** ipfs://
- **URI Hash:** Enter CID
- **Description:** Enter token description
- **Royalties:** 0

## 🌟 Token Features

- **Minting (FTs):** 🪙 Allows the issuer to mint additional tokens.
- **Burning:** 🔥 Enables token holders to destroy their tokens. For NFTs, the issuer has the exclusive right to burn.
- **Freezing:** ❄️ Allows the issuer to freeze transactions up to a specified amount for FTs, or any NFT within a class.
- **Whitelisting:** 📋 Requires accounts to be approved by the issuer to receive tokens or hold specific NFTs.
- **IBC:** 🌉 Enables token transfer across IBC-enabled chains; if disabled, the token remains within the Coreum blockchain.
- **Block Smart Contract:** 🚫 Restricts tokens to be sent only to regular user addresses, not to smart contracts.
- **Disable Sending (NFTs):** 🛑 Prevents direct transfers of NFTs between users, encouraging the use of a DEX to ensure royalty payments to creators.
- **Soulbound (NFTs):** 🧬 NFTs cannot be transferred except by the issuer, ideal for user-specific tokens.

## 📊 Manage

View and manage the Smart Tokens you own. Connect your wallet to access and administer your assets through a public REST server that provides various endpoints for querying blockchain data.
